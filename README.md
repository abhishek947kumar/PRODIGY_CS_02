# PRODIGY_CS_02
Made my 2nd project as an Intern at Prodigy InfoTech under domain Cyber Security. This is a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. By performing operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images.
Develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images. Certainly! Below is a simple Python script using the Pillow library for image processing. Make sure to install Pillow first if you haven't already: pip install pillow This script uses a simple encryption and decryption process. You can customize this method or explore other pixel manipulation techniques for more robust encryption.
