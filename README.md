Made my 2nd project as an Intern at Prodigy InfoTech under domain Cyber Security. This is a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. By performing operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images.
